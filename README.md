# ProViz

ProViz is a basic data visualization and analysis tool developed at SomaLogic.  ProViz imports an ADAT file (SomaLogic's data file format) and allows users to perform various exploratory data analytic processes:

* Merge additional sample data with the data contained in the ADAT
* Filter the ADAT to only the samples with desired characteristics
* Create groups of data through aggregating samples or splitting at specific data points
* Create interactive boxplots, CDFs, and scatter plots
* Perform basic statistical tests such as t-test, U-test, and KS-tests
