# ProViz

ProViz is a basic data visualization and analysis tool developed at SomaLogic Operating Co., Inc.  ProViz imports an ADAT file (SomaLogic's data file format) and allows users to perform various exploratory data analytic processes:

* Merge additional sample data with the data contained in the ADAT
* Filter the ADAT to only the samples with desired characteristics
* Create groups of data through aggregating samples or splitting at specific data points
* Create interactive boxplots, CDFs, and scatter plots
* Perform basic statistical tests such as t-test, U-test, and KS-tests
